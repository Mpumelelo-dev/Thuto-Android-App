 Hey there 👋😄

- 🔭 I’m currently working on  building a Mobile Application 📱💻

- 📌DESCRIPTION OF AN APP 📂  :

The mobile app that is user friendly for learners when they have to choose a career path 👨‍🏫⚕️👮👨‍🔬👩‍🌾👩‍🎤👩‍🎨👩‍💻 ,
It will have a welcome page which will enable them to also enter their names
then a learner will be able to enter their academic details(subjects and results)
the application will be able to output which faculty is their strong point based on their results
it will then ask if the person would like to see the suggested courses on that faculty or not, 
if they choose no they will have exit 🔚 option and an option to go back 🔙 and
if they choose yes it will show suggested courses and universities for that course with links to apply.
